# Contributing

*Contributions are welcome!*

To contribute a patch please fork the github [ringojs repository] and push
your changes to your own tree. When you think your code is ready and stable
create a pull request in the main repository to have your changes merged.

Please make sure to only propose one feature or bug fix per pull request.
Mixing a lot of stuff into one pull request needlessly complicates and delays
handling.

Before pouring serious work into some new feature it may be a good idea
[to let us know][community]. This way you avoid duplicating work or pouring
effort into something that has little chance to be accepted in the main tree.
