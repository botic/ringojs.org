# Contributing

Patches are welcome. Before pouring serious work into some new feature
it's a good idea to [get in touch with us][community].

The easiest way to contribute a patch is to fork the [ringojs repository]
on github, push your changes, and send a pull request or [open an issue][issues]
to request your patch to be merged in the main repository.

Another option for providing patches is to format it using the
`git format-patch` command and providing the result using [a gist][gist].
